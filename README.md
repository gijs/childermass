#Childermass
===========

> Childermass knew what old people by firesides are thinking of, though no one has asked them in years. Childermass knew what young men hear in the rattling of the drums and the tooting of the pipes that makes them leave their homes and go to be soldiers â€“ and he knew the half-eggcupful of glory and the barrelful of misery that await them.

*Susanna Clarke, Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell*

Childermass is a way to browse GitHub. It dives into the depths of repos and users and plucks out the most interesting information for you to read.

Childermass is largely an experiment with Backbone.js, sitting on top of Rails. The goal is to have a sufficiently complex example of structured, test driven Javascript for people to emulate and use in their next project.

###Developed on:

* Ruby 1.9.3-p125
* Rails 3.2.1
* Backbone.js 0.9.3
* Mustache.js

###Tested with:

* Rspec
* Jasmine
* Sinon.js

Childermass is also a character in the excellent and highly recommended book Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell by Susanna Clarke.
